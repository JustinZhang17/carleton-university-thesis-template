  abstract = {In a large, long-lived project, an effective code review process is key to ensuring the long-term quality of the code base. In this work, we study code review practices of a large, open source project, and we investigate how the developers themselves perceive code review quality. We present a qualitative study that summarizes the results from a survey of 88 Mozilla core developers. The results provide developer insights into how they define review quality, what factors contribute to how they evaluate submitted code, and what challenges they face when performing review tasks. We found that the review quality is primarily associated with the thoroughness of the feedback, the reviewer's familiarity with the code, and the perceived quality of the code itself. Also, we found that while different factors are perceived to contribute to the review quality, reviewers often find it difficult to keep their technical skills up-to-date, manage personal priorities, and mitigate context switching.},
